IOT robotics and image recognition project. A fun image recognition robot on wheels! 

In this project we used a Raspberry Pi as a local server to stream live video from a small camera. <br>

This apparatus was mounted onto a remote control truck chasis and was then piloted, streaming back to a remote computer. <br>

Live video could then be viewed through a custom web interface and still images could be captured through a gui. <br>

Google cloud API was used to send captured images to Google's image recognition cloud based platform, and results were then sent back and displayed on the webpage. <br>
